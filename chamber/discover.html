            Urban population refers to people living in urban areas as defined
            by national statistical offices. It is calculated using World Bank
            population estimates and urban ratios from the United Nations World
            Urbanization Prospects. Aggregation of urban and rural population
            may not add up to total population because of different country
            coverages.
            <br />
            Argentina urban population for 2020 was 41,796,990, a 1.11% increase

          <h2>Argentine cuisine</h2>
          <h3>
            Argentine cuisine is described as a cultural blending of
            Mediterranean influences brought by the Spanish during the colonial
            period and, later, by Italian and Spanish immigrants to Argentina
            during 19th and 20th centuries, with influences from a further
            cultural blending of criollos (due to Spanish colonizers) with the
            Indigenous peoples of Argentina (such as mate and humitas).
            Argentine annual consumption of beef has averaged 100 kg (220 lbs)
            per capita, approaching 180 kg (396 lbs) per capita during the 19th
            century; consumption averaged 67.7 kg (149 lbs) in 2007.

          <h2>Education</h2>
          <h3>
            Argentina 's education system is made up of four levels: initial ,
            primary , secondary , and higher . Argentine education is governed
            by the National Education Law 26,206 which establishes that
            education is a public good, a personal and social right of people,
            of which the State is the one who must guarantee it. It also
            determines that it is mandatory between the ages of four and 17 or
            18. The National Education Law No. 26,206 establishes that the
            country allocates 6% of its GDP to education, an index in line with
            other countries in the region but well below developed countries.
